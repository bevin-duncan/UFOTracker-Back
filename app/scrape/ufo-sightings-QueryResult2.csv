Saw multiple red lights moving in the sky in what appeared to be uniform motion, but could be wrong. Lights appeared to be traveling north or northwest slower than a plane. I viewed the phenomenon standing outside the planet fitness gym on Demaree and walnut in visalia CA, and I was facing west while filming them. The weather was cloudy at the time, very clouds where no stars were visible and I viewed the phenomenon at exactly 9:43 pm. Eventually the lights faded into the clouds and disappeared. I was able to capture footage of the event on my Samsung galaxy s10e smartphone. I drew an image of the phenomenon on a screenshot of a map and my location, although I believe it was much farther away. Hope this helps!",36.356650127226466,-119.34793664122137

Just disappeared into the ethers.  I have never witnessed anything like it in my life.  There were probably 8-10 of them in the line.  I did attempt to shoot video, but the video is black.

"red light through the sky at first, then 2 large square/rectangle were observed",Madison,WI,2020-04-26T19:45:00,unknown,"red light through the sky at first, then 2 large square/rectangle were observed This occurred on April 26, 2020 – approx 7:45 pm  One square/slightly rectangular shaped object (no lights) was flying slowly from the south/east towards the north/west and then disappeared behind some rooftops from my position/perspective.  It seemed to be sort of turning/tumbling slowly as it slowly flew by.  Right after it disappeared behind the rooftops in the north/west there was a red light coming from the same direction the first object started in (south/east) and going in the same direction (north/west).  The light flickered a little as it passed behind a tall tree.  No leaves on the tree yet, so it could still be seen as it passed behind the bare branches.  The light went out as it was passing behind this tree.  Then the exact same object as the first flew from behind the tree in the same path as the first (also no lights).  It flew slowly in the same direction and the disappeared behind the same rooftops except slightly more to the right as the first object.  No lights.  This event took roughly 4 to 5 minutes from start to finish and occurred in complete silence; no engine noise whatsoever.

I saw a half round disk object in flight zone then realized it was flying against flight path traffic normally flies.,Mesa,AZ,2014-08-26T09:50:00,disk,"I saw a half round disk object in flight zone then realized it was flying against flight path traffic normally flys. So, I am driving in the city of Mesa, Az, on 9:50 am Tuesday, 08/26/2014, it was the first cloudless day we had in last week, being that we are in monsoon season and have had a particularly rainy season this year. I see what at first appears to be a plane at a glance especially being that the area is a fly zone over falcon field and sky harbor.  Then I realize I have never seen anything flying the opposite way of falcon fields mandated flight path allows.  Another detail that had me for a split second assume it was a commercial or private plane was it looked white, and almost textured, but at this time I was looking up at it and may have been looking at the bottom.  Then I noticed it was barely swerving slightly back and forth.  So slightly that unless you stared at like I did it could appear to be going straight.  This is when I was positive it was worth taking a picture at least. If my phone wasn't on verge of dying, I would have taken a video.  As I got my phone ready to take the picture the object was getting further away quickly even though we were traveling same direction.  When I took the picture I wasn't sure if I would be able to see anything.  And when you look at the picture you almost can't see anything until you zoom in then you can see it quite clearly.  So the time I observed it was about 2 min. approximately, OR the time it takes to travel 2 miles at 40 MPH might be a more accurate way to describe it. I snapped the picture, passed two palm trees, looked back up and the object in sky was gone.  Then I saw a commercial airliner fly by and noticed distinct blinking light on the belly and obvious wing shapes which the object I saw was lacking.   I turned east and by the time I got to my destination 2 miles up the road I observed 2 air force jets both flying straight up with the afterburners on and I remember thinking that they were going much slower than the object they were chasing.   The shape of the craft appeared to be somewhat cigar shape and with the white I was seeing is why it looked at a glance like a jetliner but it quickly looked different in shape but I think this is because of the angle not that it changed in shape and became very obvious to me it was wingless.  Half round in shape.  The best thing I can think of to compare with is a bike helmet which is kind of funny to me because I imagine both the helmet and the ship were built with aerodynamics in mind.",33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

At a glance they appeared to be aircraft, with blinking lights like one would expect.   After seeing them a few nights in a row, I began to pay closer attention. I was standing in the driveway smoking a cigarette 3 nights ago, and I had watched an object fly across the sky slowly (like an aircraft) until it reached the ridge line in the distance. It then hovered in place, the light stopped blinking, and it looked like a star among the other stars in my field of view.  I looked away for one second to flip my cigarette and in that instant it disappeared from view (or so I thought).   I then spotted the object hovering on the opposite end of the ridge, where it sat for several more minutes.  After a while, I lost interest and went back inside.  They have appeared in the sky like clockwork at 11pm every night since, and are continuing to do so.  I also forgot to mention that I apparently lost more than half an hour of time by my perception when I came back inside the house, although I have no way to verify this.",37.7339,-83.0836

Just a bit after dusk, I was sitting at my backyard table in Alliston, Ontario.  My backyard faces south looking over a farmer's field.

It was travelling very fast and only lasted perhaps 5 seconds before vanishing.   I jumped up and ran to the edge of my yard, but there was no more sign of it.  It was not too high in the sky and at first I thought it might be either a comet or a drone.   There was no tail or trail behind it and since the lights were solid, I discounted both of these ideas.

My boyfriend first noticed the lights in the sky and it was odd that they weren't moving.  They didn't have the same lights that you would see on a helicopter and plane.    We saw planes coming in from a different direction as there is a airport near by.  However, unlike the airplanes, there was no movement, no change in size, and they would appear and disappear at the exact same location they had been originally.   The more we watched I noticed another light off in the distance doing the same thing.  The lights also didn't twinkle the same way as the lights in the city below did, they definitely had.  They seemed to have a more unstable light and more of pulsing light from them.  I would see them appear and disappear and not change location.   As they disappeared the light became more faint and pulsed more.   As we got in our car and went closer to the bottom of the mountain we noticed that! we were too low to see them (we originally knew they were low because we saw helicopters fly under them).

As I continued to watch this light in the eastern sky, it seemed to change color and the light almost looked as if it was revolving on top of whatever this thing was. The next strange thing I noticed is that it was making no sound what so ever, and was definitely close enough that if it had been a helicopter or other commercial aircraft, it definitely would have been making noise. I continued to watch this thing travel to the south when it made a total hairpin 90 degree turn and almost seemed to change shape as it went behind the tree.  I got up and went into my front yard and continued to watch this light change color and make what looked to be impossible movements in the sky, but traveling now to the east/southeast. The craft appeared to lower up and down a few times, and then go back to the south.  It changed from blue/green to white and then to red before it traveled out of my vision behind a row of trees. I can't be sure if the light or craft changed shape, but it looked as if it did for a second...but overall it seemed to maintain a triangle or teardrop shape throughout the sighting.",32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

The bright light was stationary.  Because the light did not move, I concluded that it was not any sort of ordinary aircraft (not a helicopter by any means, and no noise whatsoever), nor was it a balloon, because high altitude winds would cause it to move.

"Ball of light travelling high up, silent.",New Port Richey,FL,2014-09-16T06:00:00,light,"Ball of light travelling high up, silent I got up early one morning it was around 5:56am. Alarm was set for 7am but thought I’d get up and check the weather outside.  It was still dark and the sky was extremely clear, no clouds, and the stars were quite visible.  I decided to go get my camera and take some pictures of the stars since there were so many and visibility was excellent.  I looked up at a group of stars and noticed one of them was moving.  It was a ball of light, silent, and travelling fairly quickly. I thought to myself this is no star or meteorite because of the speed of the object.  I’ve seen meteorites and they fade out pretty fast and travel like a bullet and are gone.  I grabbed my camera and tried to film it with no success. It was pretty high up, maybe 3-5000 feet up.  I watched it for about 90 seconds until it was no longer in sight. Then lo and behold another appeared travelling high up and went by one of those stars that twinkle and appear to change color.  It was also high up (ball of light) and I couldn’t focus for a good picture.  At the same moment in a different area in the sky there was an airplane flying with the typical blinking navigational lights and jet engine sound.  The two were completely different. Then my attention was drawn to this apparent star that was very bright and changing color. Even to the naked eye I could see it change color. I had my camera on a tripod and started to shoot video and a few pictures. This object whatever it was bluish in color and went from a ball of light to a hexagon with a slight dark spot in the middle. Do stars change colors and shapes?? I don’t know. I thought maybe it was the Earth’s atmosphere and it’s distance from Earth that caused these variations in shape and color. Whatever it was it was fascinating to watch and I videotaped it for about 16 minutes. Unfortunately the balls of light just wouldn’t cooperate with my camera. Here’s an interesting tidbit. I was going through the reports on your site and noticed someone in Surfside Beach, SC reported a red ball of light in the sky on 9/19/14. They said when they zoomed in, it looked like a human brain with shades of gray. Although I couldn’t capture this with my camera, when I used my! binoculars to look at this apparent star, it too looked like a brain in the sky. It was really cool looking and when I went out of focus with the binoculars is when it looked like a wired brain in the sky. I thought maybe I was seeing things. Now I know someone else saw a ball of light when zooming in taking on the appearance of a brain. I think I will coin the term UFB,meaning ""unidentified flying brain”. Of course I’m poking a little fun at this but this story is absolutely true. I think many people see odd things in our skies but never take the time to ponder something really different just happened. If I can I will post the picture of this pulsating star and video on your site.",28.24270049382716,-82.67723901234567

Bright object seen over Vail for 90 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed the balloon over NM.

I was surprised to see a very bright object below and to the right of the moon, more towards the SSW.  I watched it for several minutes and it appeared completely stationary.  While it did not appear to be a bright star or planet I went back inside and checked the 'Heaven's Above' site and there was nothing seen near the moon.  I went back outside and watched the object again, and over a dozen or more employees and visitors saw the object too.  During this time the object, which had appeared to be stationary, began to move very slowly to the east.  It was still in the sky around 0810 when I went out with two employees to see if we could still see it, which we could, though it was now in the southeast and still visible despite the sun being up.  I took 8 photos with my I-phone and when enlarged on my computer do not show any detail.  The consensus of the people who saw the object was that it was a high altitude balloon. I thought it might be a large balloon, and if so would likely be known to the FAA and tracked by their radar. I called the Eagle County airport and was told that they knew nothing about large balloons in the area, and suggested I call the FAA.  Eventually I talked with a supervisor in the FAA Denver office who said they had no information on any large balloons over Vail at the time.  They suggested I contact your site. There I read about the sightings that occurred around Albuquerque/Santa Fe area on the 13th, and thought it might be the same thing.  I also read the article on the X-Calibur balloon which was interesting and if the balloon operates at 120,000 feet then it would not be a worry for the FAA.  It would be nice to know more about this balloon and if it had been launched as planned, and where it traveled to so far.  Also knowing wind directions over this time.  Fort Sumner is about 140 miles southeast of Albuquerque and the winds often come out of the southwest this time of the year, but then there might not be wind at 120,000 feet. I am a MUFON field investigator, currently inactive, who have had numerous sightings out here, so when I saw this object I thought it might be a UFO.  Eagle County is a very active area and was among the top 100 counties in the U.S. in reported UFO sightings, I think about 95th on the list.  As a MUFON investigator I have done about three dozen investigations in the area, and also have talked with dozens of people who have had good UFO sightings out here that were never officially reported.  We have had some cattle mutilations and reports of orbs over the years.  I have had several dozen good sightings myself, including three where the UFO was within a few hundred feet of me. It's amazing what you might see when you look up a lot.  I have had two good LITS sightings in the last two months, one on 8/14 and the other on 9/2, and will do reports at your sight in a day or two.  Also I will call to see if you have any more info on this X-Calibur balloon.",39.6411129032258,-106.3277741935484

The light looked white and ""flickery"" like a star looks but it's position never moved against any reference points in my window. It never grew larger or smaller either, so I surmise it was hovering. It also had no noise I could discern, nor did it project any light (like a searchlight) it just looked like a star.  I fell asleep again at 2:35 and woke back up at 2:45 and the object was gone from view completely.  I even got out of bed to see if it was now behind a tree, but it was completely gone from view.",39.7047,-105.0814

The two balls moved in a fashion that made me suspect the plane (or helicopter) must be spinning or about to crash... then, as the balls twisted around in mid air, the seem to be interacting with each other somehow.  (Truly having a panicky moment then, as I realized it was not a plane, and it was NOT a crashing plane.   The two balls then skittered off, far enough apart that I knew they were not one plane, and then sped up..  Seemingly propelled by something.

Both my husband and I have seen it before, so I watched it for a bit to make sure it was the same thing I had seen.  Both times, I noticed it was moving in odd directions, up, down, diagonal, and sometimes a sort of circle.

I went in to tell my husband and we watched it together.  My kids saw us staring at the sky and started watching and noticed the twinkling lights as well.  It was visible for a few hours and I think the clouds dimmed it out and it just faded away.   During that time, maybe half an hour before we lost visual contact, we saw what looked like a comet or fireball in the sky.

Low-frequency pulsing hum associated with aircraft lights flying around for over 40 minutes,Oakville,ON,2015-01-12T23:00:00,unknown,"low frequency pulsing hum associated with aircraft lights flying around for over 40 minutes Woke up from a light sleep by an irritating low frequency pulsing hum that could not be localized, It felt as if it was inside my head.  Got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was any machinery on the street.  You could describe the sound as being like the idle of an engine but only in terms of rhythm.  This frequency was much lower than any engine.  I could almost feel this hum throughout my body. When I looked out onto the street, there was no activity.  However, there was what appeared to be several aircraft each with multiple lights in the sky.   After watching for a couple of minutes the configuration of the lights changed with the direction of the movement.  So you could assume the multiple white lights were at the front and multiple red lights at the rear.  The rear red lights were in two rows on top of each other which gave the appearance of a straight flat surface at the back of the craft.  The lights themselves looked like running lights (small, singular, but bright).  When the craft appeared sideways you could see much less white at the front and similarly red at the back with large dark gap (lack of any lights) at the sides.   Since it was night and the sky was clear yet dark, I could not discern any solid shape other than what you might think is shape determined by the configuration of the lights.  My window points south towards the lake whose shoreline is only 1 mile away.  Two craft were just west of my position (right) and were off shore heading inland (toward but just west of my house).  They were low on the horizon.  As they passed, I could not see an underside of the craft.   They were moving very slowly, (much slower than any small plane) and made no noise.  The third craft was some distance away to the far south east and much less visible but appeared to be just hovering (stationary).  Feeling awkward about what I had seen, I tried to go back asleep.  But the hum continued.   I could not fall back asleep and the hum seem to grow louder again.  So I got up and went to the window again.  This time, the aircraft were south and east of my house.  Their movement appeared to be along the shoreline, heading north, then south in a zig zag pattern heading from west to east. The distant craft was still stationary off to the south east. When I went to the back window I expected to see the craft continue further inland (north) and west (left) from my position. But I could see nothing.  Seems as though their flight pattern would zag, about where my house was as a distance from the lake, and they would head back south again. I went and got a pair of binoculars.  The configuration of the lights were clearer but I could still not determine the shape of the object.   Again, I felt a little silly with my wife sleeping beside me while I walk about the bedroom peering out of the windows, so I tried to go back asleep again.   The hum continued (never abated), and again got more intense, so I got out of bed again to have a look.  This continued for over 40 minutes.  I know because the hockey game was on (was falling asleep to it) and 2 periods had passed while this was happening.  Also, at one point the tv signal got scrambled for a brief moment which I thought was odd (not unlike everything else that was going on).   The objects continued eastward zigzagging north then south.  As they got more distant, I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep. The closes proximity I would say was practically over my house just to the east at a fairly low altitude 1500–2000 feet, but I could still not see any underside (nor lights).   The size would be that of a single engine 4 seat plane.  They made no noise.",43.46031845574388,-79.71625894538606

I was watching the sky from my window and saw a streak of light that appeared to be moving very slowly at an angle of 25-35 degrees in a southerly direction.  I looked at it through my 8X binoculars, when I first saw the streak and it was near the middle of the field of view with the lower edge of the field on the water/Whidbey Island edge. (I don't know if that is helpful - it's a way to locate raptors for birdwatchers.) I was able to watch the streak through my spotting scope which has a zoom lens 20X to 50X, and it looked like dense orange burning gasses getting less dense toward the end, but not fading very much.  I could see no object associated with this streak of light, just the look of roiling, burning gasses.  It did not leave a trail as it moved, but moved as one entity.  As the streak was moving toward then behind the mountains, it passed an adjacent mountain peak, possibly Mt. Olympus.  The streak was about 2/3 the size of the silouetted slope of that mountain peak, so it must have been very large.  Mt. Olympus is about 70-80 miles away as the crow flies from Everett.

There was no sound, although I can't hear aircraft at that height either, they clearly were not aircraft or balloons.

Seagulls morph into glowing UFO's.  ((NUFORC Note:  Images are not apparent in video provided by witness.

I looked up to admire the beautiful weather and the clear sky.   I noticed a group of seagulls flying in formation.  They passed, then three seagulls remained flying in the air without the rest of the group.   As I continued to watch the birds I kept thinking my mind was playing tricks on me due to the height of the birds.  They seemed to be flying higher and higher in the sky with a swirl type motion without flapping their wings.  Then the more I looked at the birds, the wings seemed to morph into their bodies.   I was only able to focus on one bird as they appeared smaller.  It got smaller and smaller then turned into a white dot in the sky.   The next thing that happened is that it started to glow a white bright light.   Then, lastly, it turned into a tiny, red, glowing dot in the sky.  It was the size of a tiny star in the sky, but glowing red in broad daylight in a clear blue sky.   It was the most bizarre thing I think I ever witnessed.   Basically, I saw a seagull turn into a glowing orb.   The best part about it was I caught it on my iPhone.  It is very hard to see.

I was out side the house and I looked up to see a red light that had evidently just pass over me from behind.  Though I do not know how high it was, it did not seem to be be more than several thousand feet up. The fact that I heard no noise was strange.  All the time the object was red with a green blinking light. The object continued on a short ways in front of me(heading south)and then it hovered for a short while and then backed up, then in move to my right (west) and stopped again.  I just went outside again and I note it is overcast outside.  As the red light did not seem to be obscured at all, this seems to verify the fact that it could not have been to high in the sky.

Lewis in nearby, I am accustom to seeing the aircraft they operate a lot and this was nothing like like a helicopter.  When it stopped there was no deceleration and when it moved again there was no acceleration.  Though its speed was about the same as a helicopter, the fact that it made no noise at all makes me think it was something else.

My wife and I were coming home from a play in Bellingham.  I was driving West on St Highway 20, 3 miles east of Anacortes.   As I was watching the next set of traffic lights, I noticed something that caught my eye above the traffic lights.  They seemed to be off the coast and over the water.  I drove through the intersection and they were still there.  There were about 8 yellowish colored lights in a circle about 25 degrees above the horizon. Down and to the left of the larger circle formation there was another formation.  It was smaller, maybe 5 lights.  The lights stayed in place, and did not change their relationship for a couple minutes.   We then pulled over on the highway near another car that had stopped and was also looking at the lights.  Then the lights started to change their spatial relationship with the other lights.  There was no audible noise.    The lights then started to just fade out one at a time.  It was cloudy and some fog outside.  My wife during this time had gotten out of the car and was attempting to photograph them with her phone. We live in Oak Harbor, which is home to Whidbey Naval Air Base.  We are very familiar with the Navy planes.  They usually fly in pairs and at most 3-4 planes in a formation.   I am a private pilot and very familiar with the airspace and the planes that fly in it.  It was hard to judge how far away the lights were, but they were not airplanes or helicopters.",48.4648,-122.6092

It was very big, very bright, very still and very quite. Now my neighborhood has alot of dogs and is normally a bit noisy, but since seeing and watching the lights in the sky it was absolutely silent outside. After about two and a half hours of watching the sky the lights appeared to shift into what looked like one light that wasn't as bright as the four. The lights then began to move slowly behind my house out of my sight to which I ran outside to see how far it had moved, and it was gone. I continued to watch the sky for about thirty minutes, as I was still stunned and shocked that the enormous light had disappeared so quickly. I also noticed that the planes that were flying by had stopped as well.  By this time its 11pm and I went to bed.",30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

My daughters and I were heading home from church, northbound on 400 around 9:00pm, between exits 12 and 13, just past the Siemens.  I spotted a bright object in the sky up ahead and as we were talking, I kept noticing the object wasn't moving and was getting closer, meaning we were moving and the object wasn't. I finally said to my daughters, ""Look at that thing in the sky.""  Neither of them believed and didn't look up...I am always pulling jokes on them and being silly.  One of my daughters said it was probably a star, sarcastically, but the night sky was completely overcast...not a star in the sky.  The back drop was an orange tint to the skyline. When I finally said it again, we were almost under it and my curiosity grew when I didn't see a pole anywhere in site.  I was thinking it was one of those towers with brinking lights, only they weren't blinking.  As we got right under the object, my other daughter finally looked out the window and almost cussed, saying, ""Holy.....oh my gosh dad!!!!""   She rolled the window down and started making out what she was seeing.  She said it was a longer shaped sphere, no wings, no propellers, about 300-400 feet in the air.  There were 2 extremely bright lights on either side of the object and a blue lights that looked like it was underneath or coming from inside.  It hovered, completely motionless as we passed by....my other daughter wanted to see it but the other daughters head and body were in the way.   I told her to look out the back window and that's when they both said it was gone....

An airplane passing below it going in the opposite direction (eastish?) made me notice that the object didn't have any sort of lights- only the reflection of the sun on its surface.
